## Introduction
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.
Dannyâ€™s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## ðŸ“š Business Task
In this session I assisted Danny to answer some question about his customers, such as;
* their visiting patterns
* how much money theyâ€™ve spent
* which menu items are their favourite. 

These answers will help Danny to have a deeper connection with his customers and deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

## Motive 
Danny plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program.
